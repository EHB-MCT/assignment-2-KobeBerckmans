# Project Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of the project. It includes completed tasks, ongoing work, issues, and upcoming milestones.

---

## Version History
- **v1.0** – Initial project setup, added basic HTML structure, and included JavaScript files.
- **v1.1** – Integrated JSON data for step tracking and graph generation using Chart.js.
- **v1.2** – Enhanced data analysis in `analyze.js` to calculate average steps, identify the most active day, and assess trends.
- **v1.3** – Finalized the user interface, added tooltips, and ensured error handling for JSON loading.

---

## Completed Tasks
- **Set up project structure**: Created initial files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `analyze.js`).
- **Integrated JSON file reading**: `script.js` now fetches step data from `steps.json`.
- **Chart.js integration**: Displayed the step data graphically using `Chart.js` with labels and step count data.
- **Data Analysis**: Implemented the calculation of average steps, most active day, and trend in `analyze.js`.
- **Results storage**: Stored the output (average steps, most active day, trend) in `results.json` for use in the front-end.
- **Removed comments from code**: Cleaned up code by removing unnecessary comments for clarity.

---

## Ongoing Work
- **Enhancing Data Analysis**: Looking into adding more analysis features (e.g., step goals, comparison with previous months).
- **UI Enhancements**: Improving the display of step data and charts, including adding interactivity or animations.

---

## Upcoming Tasks
- **Testing**: Perform thorough testing of the app to ensure that data is displayed correctly on all devices.
- **Documentation**: Complete the user guide and ensure all code is well-commented and documented.
- **Performance Optimization**: Investigate ways to optimize the loading time of large data sets.

---

## Issues / Blockers
- **Data Fetching**: Sometimes, there are issues with loading `steps.json` from the file system. This needs to be addressed by improving the fetch error handling.

---

## Milestones
- **Milestone 1**: Basic functionality with step data displayed in a graph (Completed)
- **Milestone 2**: Fully implemented data analysis and result generation (Completed)
- **Milestone 3**: UI polish and testing (In progress)
- **Milestone 4**: Final release and documentation (Upcoming)
